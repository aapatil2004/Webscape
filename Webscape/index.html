        <h2>About Chandrayan 3</h2>
        <p>
            Chandrayaan-3 is India's third lunar mission that aims to achieve a soft landing on the Moon near the south pole region1. The spacecraft consists of an orbiter, a lander and a rover1. The launch of Chandrayaan-3 was originally planned for 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic2. The latest information suggests that the launch will take place in the third quarter of 20222. The lander and rover are expected to land on the Moon in August 2022.
